{"name":"Searchclip","tagline":"Search by double tapping ctrl-c","body":"### SearchClip\r\nThis utility lets you search from any Windows application which had selectable text. When SearchClip is running, it monitors the keyboard and if ctrl-c is pressed twice within the mouse double click time then it launches a browser of your choice to search for the selected text (using a search engine of your choice).\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Windows, simply sync this repository and you'll see the new branch. Alternatively, just get the 1.0 release which is already compiled.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJust me, @cskilbeck.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf it doesn't work right, please let me know, or submit a fix :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
